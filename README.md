# ChessSL
ChessSL application is my first python pfoject. I used this app to conduct study for my MA thesis, which aimed to determine whether trained chess players succumb to the _selective laziness of reasoning_ phenomenon. ChessSL app is divided into two parts and each of them allowed me to collect specific data in a highly standardized way.

## ChessSL1
After carrying the subject through instructions, the program shows sequentially three chess positions and measures time intended for their analysis. After each position, a window pops out in which the subject answers some questions and types his thoughts about this particular position. Time intended for answering questions is measured by another timer which changes its color for the red in the last minute of the time. All answers are saved in the text file.

## ChessSL2
ChessSL2 is very similar to the ChessSL1 program. This time, however, next to each chess position pops out a couple of windows with analysis of this position provided by other chess players. The task is to assess these analyses. Time is limited and all answers are saved in the text files.
